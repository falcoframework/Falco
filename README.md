[Falco](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco) is a toolkit for building fast and functional-first web applications using F#.

- Built upon the high-performance components of ASP.NET Core.
- Optimized for building HTTP applications quickly.
- Seamlessly integrates with existing .NET Core middleware and libraries.

## Key Features

- Asynchronous [request handling](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/tree/master/documentation/response.md).
- Simple and powerful [routing](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/tree/master/documentation/routing.md) API.
- Fast, secure and configurable [web server](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/tree/master/documentation/host.md).
- Native F# [view engine](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco.Markup).
- Uniform API for [accessing request data](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/tree/master/documentation/request.md).
- [Authentication and security](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/tree/master/documentation/security.md) utilities.
- Built-in support for [large uploads](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/tree/master/documentation/request.md#multipartform-data-binding) and [binary responses](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/tree/master/documentation/response.md#content-disposition).

## Design Goals

- Provide a toolset to build a working full-stack web application.

## Why "Falco"?

[Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel) has been a game changer for the .NET web stack. In the animal kingdom, "Kestrel" is a name given to several members of the falcon genus. Also known as "Falco".
