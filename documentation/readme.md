# Welcome to Falco's Documentation

Visit the [getting started](get-started.md) page for installation and a brief overview. There are also more detailed [examples](example-hello-world.md) that shows how to create a small but complete application with Falco. The rest of the docs describe each component of Falco in detail.

## Guides

Falco depends only on the high-performance base components of .NET and ASP.NET Core, and provides a toolset to build a working full-stack web application. This section of the documentation explains the different parts of Falco and how they can be used, customized, and extended.
